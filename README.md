Multinational-Retail-Data-Centralisation

The context of this project is that I work for a multinational company that sells various goods across the globe. Currently, their sales data is spread across many different data sources making it not easily accessible or analyzable by current members of the team. In an effort to become more data-driven, my organization would like to make its sales data accessible from one centralized location. My first goal will be to produce a system that stores the current company data in a database so that it's accessed from one centralized location and acts as a single source of truth for sales data. I will then query the database to get up-to-date metrics for the business.
